IMAGE UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS

I've noticed that only 2 of your project images are displaying correctly. This is because the server is having trouble with spaces and special characters in the filenames.

Please follow these steps to fix the image issues:

1. Create a new folder structure in your project:
   - Create a folder called "images/projects_fixed" in your portfolio_site directory

2. Upload your project images with these simpler filenames:
   - For Chatbot project: 
     Upload to: images/projects_fixed/chatbot.png
   
   - For Business 360 Dashboard (main image): 
     Upload to: images/projects_fixed/business360.jpeg
   
   - For Business 360 Dashboard (thumbnail 1): 
     Upload to: images/projects_fixed/business360_detail1.jpeg
   
   - For Business 360 Dashboard (thumbnail 2): 
     Upload to: images/projects_fixed/business360_detail2.jpeg
   
   - For Sales Insights: 
     Upload to: images/projects_fixed/sales_insights.jpeg
   
   - For P&L Report: 
     Upload to: images/projects_fixed/pl_report.png
   
   - For Real Estate Price Prediction: 
     Upload to: images/projects_fixed/realestate.png
   
   - For Brewdog Beer Analysis: 
     Upload to: images/projects_fixed/brewdog.png

3. After uploading all images, let me know and I'll update your HTML to use these new image paths.

Note: The profile image seems to be working correctly, so we don't need to change that one.
